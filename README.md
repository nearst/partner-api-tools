# NearSt Partner API tools

This repository contains a set of tools for working with
the [NearSt Partner API](https://developers.near.st/partner-api). These tools can be used to test
webhooks, view examples of UI integrations, and explore the API using an interactive console.


## Tools

### Webhooks Tester

The Webhooks Tester is a simple web application built on the Serverless framework that shows a visual representation of
inventory updates sent through the Webhooks API. Deploy the app and set up the Webhooks channel for a store to get
started.

### Example UI

The Example UI is a visual representation of the steps to take to integrate the NearSt Partner API into your
application. It demonstrates how to use the API to create a retailer with multiple stores, retrieve a list of POS
providers, set up the POS integration, and enable a channel.

### Example API Console

The Example API Console is a simple example of how to use the Partner API to list retailers and stores, and how to
display visual information that will help users to take appropriate action to set up their local inventory integration.


## Usage

To use any of these tools, simply clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README file for each tool.
Some tools may require additional setup, such as configuring environment variables or installing dependencies.

Please note that these tools are intended for educational and testing purposes only, and should not be used in
production environments. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and follow best practices for securing your API
credentials and handling user data.
